 streamlined approach to creating and administering multiple-choice quizzes using HTML, CSS, and
 JavaScript. This application enables users to upload questions and answers from an Excel file, a lowing for
 quick and easy creation of quizzes. Utilizing the XLSX library, the script efficiently reads and processes
 Excel files, dynamica ly generating quiz questions for the user. The aesthetic design of the application,
 achieved through advanced CSS techniques, ensures a visua ly appealing and user-friendly interface, while
 JavaScript handles the logic for displaying questions and evaluating answers.
 This project not only simplifies the process of quiz creation but also enhances the user experience through
 a clean and monochromatic design. After quiz completion, users are directed to a results page where their
 performance is evaluated, displaying correct and incorrect answers with clear visual indicators. The
 application also supports the functionality to retake quizzes, further enhancing its usability.

 improves efficiency and user satisfaction in educational environments. As digital learning continues to
 grow, such web-based tools become increasingly valuable, offering scalable and customizable solutions for
